Custom Wordpress Theme written with the following tools:
* SASS (http://sass-lang.com/)
* 960.css (http://960.gs/)
* PrettyPhoto (http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/)

This custom Wordpress theme has three custom post types and is mostly meant for the use case of this website, though as I work on it more and more I'll do what I can to make it more and more generalized and customizable.

The theme does take use of the Advanced Custom Fields post http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/adding-custom-fields-to-a-custom-post-type-the-right-way
